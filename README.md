# sign-in-sign-up-animated
This is an demo file of a web sign in and sign up page. Here I used little css animation effect to give a better look of the page. Here I made the input options hover and focus effect to make it animated looking. Fonts are given little big to see clear even in responsive mood. Hope you will like it.
